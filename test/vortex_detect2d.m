function [positions, winding] = vortex_detect2d(psi)
% Detect vortices in a field psi, on plaquettes of a 2D grid.
%
% First we localize vortices on the grid plaquettes using the phase winding
% algorithm.  After we've found which grid plaquettes contain vortices, we
% estimate the positions more accurately by solving the equations
%
%   real(psi(x,y)) = 0, imag(psi(x,y)) = 0
%
% In principle we could do this using the exact psi as computed via spectral
% interpolation (provided psi is defined in a spectral basis) but that would
% probably be relatively slow.  Instead, we make a linear approximation over
% the plaquette for the real and imaginary parts of psi, and find the position
% where these approximations are mutually zero.  This corresponds to the
% position of the vortex.
%
% The linear approximations are computed from the values of psi at the corners
% of the plaquette using least squares.
%
% Inputs:
%   psi - complex wavefunction in which to detect vortices.
%
% Outputs:
%   positions - Array of vortex positions with shape 2xN where N is the number
%               of vortices:  [ x1  x2  x3 ... xN ]
%                             [ y1  y2  y3 ... yN ]
%   winding - The vortex winding number of the positions array, +1 or -1.

positions = [ix,iy]';

% Compute least squares estimator for the linear function coefficients on a
% plaquette.  Suppose the real part of psi on a plaquette containing a vortex
% is
%
%   [r1 r2;
%    r3 r4]
%
% We want to fit a plane (a*x + b*y + c) to this such that
%
%   r1 = a*0 + b*0 + c*1
%   r2 = a*1 + b*0 + c*1
%   r3 = a*0 + b*1 + c*1
%   r4 = a*1 + b*1 + c*1
%
% In matrix form, that would be L * [a;b;c] = [r1;r2;r3;r4], which is the
% origin of the mysterious looking matrix below.
