## TODO
- [ ] Periodic vortex detection
- [ ] Detection precision and speed tests
- [x] Test against linear solve (Foster). Conclusion is that linear interp is not very accurate. Doesn't improve much on grid resolution.
- [x] Remove/change Interpolations dependency of cores to fix incremental pre-compilation issue
- [x] minimise `@reexport` usage
- [ ] Implement RCA
