## TODO
- [ ] Make Torus periodic?
- [ ] Periodic vortex detection
- [ ] Implement RCA.
- [ ] More detection precision and speed tests
- [ ] Trim allocations on `findvortices`
- [ ] Test against a very fine reference grid.
- [x] Remove/change interpolations dependency of cores to fix incremental pre-compilation issue (fixed?)
- [x] minimise `@reexport` usage
- [x] Test against linear solve (Foster). (result: slower)
- [x] Test against gaussian density. (result: slower)
