## TODO
- [ ] Make Torus periodic?
- [ ] Periodic vortex detection
- [ ] Implement RCA.
- [ ] More detection precision and speed tests
- [x] Test against linear solve (Foster). (result: slower)
- [x] Test against gaussian density. (result: slower)
- [ ] Test against a very fine reference grid.
- [ ] Remove/change interpolations dependency of cores to fix incremental pre-compilation issue.
- [x] minimise `@reexport` usage
- [ ] Trim allocations on `find_vortices`
